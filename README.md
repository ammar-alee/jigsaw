# Jigsaw

Jigsaw is Draftbit's official component library and design system. This is the library we use internally to make sure that your fonts, colors, shadows, and spcaing all match what we have in our builder ðŸ˜ƒ

## Requirements
- Node.js
- Yarn / npm

## Getting Started

Run `yarn install` or `npm install` on your machine to install all the required dependencies.

## Example App

To run the example app, run `yarn install` or `npm install` in the root directory, then cd into `example` and run `npm run start` or `yarn start`. This should start up an expo session for you.
